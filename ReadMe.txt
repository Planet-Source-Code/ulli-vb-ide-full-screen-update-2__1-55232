This little AddIn toggles VB's code pane windows between normal display mode and full screen display mode. Simply compile the .dll into your VB folder and then use the Add-Ins manager to load it into VB.

Updates include: safeguard against accidentaly closing a codepane or VB while in maximized state, and an emergeny fallback in case VB crashes while maximized. So the necessity to manually re-do the registry after a crash should have gone.

The Add-In can now safely be loaded thru the Add-Ins Manager and will install the menu button.

Hold down LeftShift while clicking on Full Screen or pressing the Hotkey (Alt+S) to keep the Menus.
